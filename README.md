# Human_Action_recognition

Human activity recognition, or HAR for short, is a broad field of study concerned with identifying
the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data.

Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting. 
They may also be more focused activities such as those types of activities performed in a kitchen or on a factory floor.

The sensor data may be remotely recorded, such as video, radar, or other wireless methods.
Alternately, data may be recorded directly on the subject such as by carrying custom hardware or smart phones that have accelerometers and gyroscopes.

**The link bellow contains a dataset for our model:**
 - **This dataset contains 11 folders for different activities, each folder contains allmost 2500 images**

**Here are the steps we will perform:**

- **Step 1: Download and Extract the Dataset**
- **Step 2: Visualize the Data with its Labels**
- **Step 3: Read and Preprocess the Dataset**
- **Step 4: Split the Data into Train and Test Set**
- **Step 5: Construct the Model**
- **Step 6: Compile & Train the Model**
- **Step 7: Plot Modelâ€™s Loss & Accuracy Curves**
- **Step 8: Make Predictions with the Model**
